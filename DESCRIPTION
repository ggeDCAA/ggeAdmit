Description: This package contains scripts for administering the holistic review process in graduate admissions. Holistic review entails evaluating the "total applicant" - that is, the experiences, abilities, and contributions of the person applying, rather than a test score or two. Ultimately the package will include functions for a complete reviewer assignments and applicant ranking workflow.
